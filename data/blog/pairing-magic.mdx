A few days ago I had the pleasure of paired programming for the first time with Ben Holmen ([@benholmen.com](https://bsky.app/profile/benholmen.com) on 🦋). Great chat, wonderful developer, and I can happily say that he turned me on to the idea of paired programming with strangers as a way to meet other devs and grow my professional network. Genius!

# What is the Pair-amid Scheme 🔺

You can read more about Ben's take [here](https://benholmen.com/blog/pairing-magic/), but the gist of it is that a dev offers their calendar open to book a few paired programming slots per week (in my case I limit mine to 2/week).

Ideally the person requesting the pairing has something to work on, but if the time devolves into general chatting about software development, that's also a success!

If you'd like to book a paired programming session we me, you can find my booking link below.

Looking forward to pairing with you soon!
